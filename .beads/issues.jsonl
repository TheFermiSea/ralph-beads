Read specs for acceptance criteria\n2. Create child tasks from criteria\n3. Implement and validate\n4. Close when all criteria met\n\n## Key Features\n- bd prime context reload every iteration\n- Molecule-based workflow execution\n- Circuit breaker (block after 2 failures)\n- Wisp support for discovered work","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:02:12.750641-06:00","created_by":"briansquires","updated_at":"2026-01-11T14:02:12.750641-06:00"}
